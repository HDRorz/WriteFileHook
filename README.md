# WriteFileHook
A .net C# winAPI Hook example

Base On [Deviare2]("https://github.com/nektra/Deviare2")

Here is a experiment to hook a existed program and get what it is logging.
I expect that the project works as a proxy and the program will contine 
write log to files and also send the log content to remote DataCenter.
